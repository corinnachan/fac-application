								<h2>Why I'd like to join the Summer 2024 FAC Cohort</h2>
								<p>I am hugely passionate about encouraging more women and under-represented groups to become developers, and aspire to be a role model for those who join this career from non-traditional paths after I do so myself. After many years of working adjacently to developers in my career and teaching myself to code in a hobbyist capacity, I am keen to build a foundation where I could realistically pursure developer roles in a professional capacity. Scroll down to learn more about my coding journey to date and key people who have inpsired me along the way! </p>

								<h2>ShePlusPlus London | Dec 2017 </h2>
								<p>I have always dreamed of being a personal website, but had no idea where to start. ShePlusPlus introduced me to the wonderful world of GitHub Pages, and I finally made some progress on building my own site! I learned about Jekyll and discovered the beautiful templates that form the basis of my site today! :) </p>

								<h2>Rails Girls London | Dec 2018
								</h2>
								<p> This weekend was pivotal for two reasons: 1) I learned about <a href="https://twitter.com/codingwithclair">@codingwithclair</a>'s incredible journey of being a self-taught coder and pivoted her career from advertising into software engineering; 2) I learned about <a href="https://codebar.io/">codebar</a>, which became an intrumental support network in my own coding journey. At codebar I also met a FAC alumna who highly recommended FAC to me, and the idea has stuck with me since! I continued to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript throughout 2019. </p>

								</h2>
								<p>After a long hiatus during the COVID years to prioritise reconnecting with people IRL, I was re-inspired to consider a career in development again at PyLadies Dublin, where Melina Zhang gave an in-person talk on her career change at age 41 to become a junior dev. </p>
